Okay, acting as a Financial Data Scientist, let's break down how we can perform an in-depth analysis of this risk review data in Power BI, focusing on advanced techniques and visualizations without using explicit DAX queries. We'll leverage Power Query for data handling and Power BI's visual capabilities.

Data Understanding:

First, let's understand the variables provided:

LOD Team: Line of Defense Team (e.g., L2C - likely Second Line Control). Categorical. Represents the team performing or overseeing the review.
Quarter: Time period of the review (e.g., 2025 Q1). Temporal.
Review_Name: Specific name or type of the review conducted (e.g., HR Accounting & IFRS 2). Categorical.
L3risks: Granular description of the identified risk (e.g., "Breach of regulatory..."). Textual/Categorical. This seems to be the most specific risk level.
Legal Entities: Identifier related to the legal entity structure (e.g., SG, HONG KONG, INDIA, etc.). Potentially geographic or organizational. Needs clarification if 'SG' and 'SINGAPOUR' refer to the same entity - assuming they are distinct as per the "clean data" instruction, but noting this.
L2Risks: A higher-level risk category (e.g., "Compliance and other dispute..."). Categorical. L3risks likely roll up into L2Risks.
Location: Geographic location associated with the risk/review (e.g., HONG KONG, INDIA, SINGAPORE, TAIWAN). Geographic. This seems more standardized for mapping than 'Legal Entities'.
Goal: Analyze risk distribution, concentration, and relationships across teams, time, geography, and risk categories using advanced Power BI features.

Step-by-Step Analysis Plan in Power BI:

Step 1: Load Data into Power BI Desktop

Open Power BI Desktop.
Get Data -> Select appropriate source (e.g., Excel, CSV, Text).
Load the provided data into Power BI.
Step 2: Advanced Data Handling & Transformation (Power Query Editor)

Rationale: While the data is "clean", we can enrich it and structure it better for advanced analysis without changing the core information. This is done in the Power Query Editor (Transform data button).
Duplicate Columns for Different Roles:
Duplicate the Location column. Rename the duplicate to Country. This gives us a dedicated, clean geographic column for mapping visuals. Assuming 'Location' represents the country level accurately.
Duplicate L2Risks and L3risks if you plan to use one version for display (potentially shortened) and another for relationships or filtering. (Optional for this dataset size).
Parse Quarter Column:
Select the Quarter column.
Go to Add Column tab -> Column From Examples -> From Selection.
Type 2025 in the first row of the new column dialogue. Power Query should infer you want to extract the year. Name this column Year.
Repeat the process: Add Column -> Column From Examples -> From Selection. Type Q1. Name this column Quarter Name.
Advanced Handling: Create a numerical quarter for sorting. Add Column -> Conditional Column.
Name: Quarter Number
If Quarter Name equals Q1 then 1
If Quarter Name equals Q2 then 2
If Quarter Name equals Q3 then 3
If Quarter Name equals Q4 then 4
Else null (or 0).
Change the data type of Year and Quarter Number to Whole Number.
Benefit: Allows slicing by Year and Quarter independently, proper sorting of quarters, and creation of time hierarchies.
Create Unique Identifier (Good Practice):
Go to Add Column tab -> Index Column -> From 1.
Name this UniqueID.
Benefit: Ensures each row is uniquely identifiable, which can be helpful for certain complex visuals or troubleshooting, although not strictly needed for basic counts.
Group Similar Text (Example - If L3Risks were more varied):
Illustrative Advanced Technique (less relevant for this specific sample but good to know): If L3risks had slight variations (e.g., "Breach of Reg." vs "Regulatory Breach"), you could use:
Add Column -> Conditional Column to group them based on keywords (Text.Contains logic available in the advanced conditional column editor or via custom columns if needed, although custom columns might veer close to query language).
Or use Group By on L3risks and then merge back to standardize.
For this data: The L3 risk text is consistent, so this isn't immediately necessary but demonstrates a data handling capability.
Close & Apply: Load the transformed data into the Power BI model view.
Step 3: Data Modeling (Minimal for this single table)

Since it's a single flat table, no complex relationships are needed yet.
Ensure data types are correct (Text, Whole Number, etc.) in the Data view.
Mark the Country column for geographic use: Select Country column -> Column tools tab -> Data category -> Country.
Step 4: Implicit Measures & Basic Report Setup

Power BI automatically creates implicit measures. The most useful here will be Count of UniqueID (or count of any column, like LOD Team) to represent the number of risk instances recorded.
Set up the report canvas with a consistent theme and maybe a title.
Step 5: Advanced Visualizations & Analysis

Focus: Using visuals that provide deeper insights or handle complexity well. We will use the implicit Count of UniqueID as our primary value, representing the number of risk records.
Decomposition Tree (Advanced Exploration):
Visual: Add a Decomposition Tree visual from the Visualizations pane.
Setup:
Analyze: Count of UniqueID (Drag UniqueID here, Power BI will default to Count).
Explain by: Add L2Risks, Country, LOD Team, Legal Entities, Year, Quarter Name.
Analysis: This is highly interactive. Start by clicking the '+' next to the total count. Choose L2Risks to see the breakdown. Then, click the '+' next to a specific L2 Risk category and choose Country to see where that risk type is most prevalent. Continue drilling down through different dimensions (LOD Team, Legal Entities).
Advanced Aspect: Allows dynamic, multi-dimensional drill-down driven by the user, revealing hierarchical contributions without pre-defined paths. Excellent for root cause analysis or exploring concentrations.
Matrix with Conditional Formatting & Hierarchy (Advanced Table):
Visual: Add a Matrix visual.
Setup:
Rows: Add L2Risks, then L3risks below it (creating a hierarchy). Enable the +/- icons in Row Headers formatting.
Columns: Add Country.
Values: Count of UniqueID.
Advanced Formatting:
Select the Matrix -> Go to Format your visual -> Cell elements.
Select Count of UniqueID in the series dropdown.
Turn Background color ON. Click fx. Set rules (e.g., Color Scale from White to Red) based on risk count to visually highlight hotspots.
Optionally, turn Data bars ON for another visual cue within cells.
Optionally, turn Icons ON. Click fx. Define rules to show icons (e.g., Red circle for counts > X, Yellow for counts > Y, Green otherwise).
Analysis: Provides a structured overview of which specific risks (L3) within broader categories (L2) are appearing in which countries. Conditional formatting immediately draws attention to high-frequency risk intersections. The hierarchy allows users to expand/collapse risk categories.
Map Visualisation (Geographic Insight):
Visual: Add a Map or Azure Map visual.
Setup:
Location: Country (the column we marked as geographic).
Bubble size (Map) or Size (Azure Map): Count of UniqueID.
Optional: Legend (Map) or Color > Fill Color > fx (Azure Map): Use L2Risks to color-code bubbles by risk category, or use conditional formatting on Count.
Analysis: Visually represents the geographic concentration of risks. Larger bubbles indicate locations with more recorded risk instances. Color-coding can add another dimension (e.g., which type of risk is dominant where).
Advanced Aspect: Geospatial analysis, leveraging the geographic data category. Azure Maps offers more advanced features like reference layers or traffic (less relevant here).
Treemap (Proportional Analysis):
Visual: Add a Treemap.
Setup:
Category: L2Risks (or L3risks for more detail).
Values: Count of UniqueID.
Analysis: Shows the proportion of total risks contributed by each risk category. The size of the rectangle directly represents its share of the total count. Good for quickly identifying the most frequent risk types overall.
Advanced Aspect: Effective for visualizing part-to-whole relationships with many categories.
Custom Tooltips (Contextual Detail):
Create a Tooltip Page:
Create a new report page.
In the Format page pane -> Page information -> Turn Allow use as tooltip ON.
Set the Page size -> Type to Tooltip.
Add visuals to this page, e.g., a Card showing First L2Risks, another Card showing First L3risks, maybe a small Table showing counts by LOD Team for the specific data point. Filter these visuals using the fields that will be passed from the main visual (Power BI does this automatically for tooltip pages).
Apply the Tooltip:
Go back to your main report page. Select a visual (e.g., the Map or the Matrix).
Go to Format visual -> General -> Tooltips.
Set Type to Report page.
Select your newly created tooltip page under Page.
Analysis: When hovering over a data point (e.g., a bubble on the map, a cell in the matrix), instead of the default tooltip, your custom mini-report appears, providing much richer context without cluttering the main visual.
Advanced Aspect: Significantly enhances data exploration by providing curated, detailed information on demand.
Step 6: Interactivity and User Experience

Slicers: Add slicers for key dimensions: Year, Quarter Name, LOD Team, Country, L2Risks. Use the hierarchy slicer custom visual (import from AppSource) for a better experience with L2Risks/L3Risks if needed.
Cross-Filtering: Ensure visuals interact with each other (default Power BI behaviour). Clicking on a country in the Map should filter the Matrix and Decomposition Tree, etc.
Bookmarks & Buttons (Navigation):
Create different views of the report focused on specific questions (e.g., Geographic View, Risk Category View, Team View) by arranging visuals and applying filters.
Create Bookmarks (View tab -> Bookmarks) for each state. Crucially, update the bookmark to control Data, Display, and Current Page appropriately.
Add Buttons (Insert tab -> Buttons) and assign Action -> Type: Bookmark -> Select the corresponding bookmark.
Advanced Aspect: Creates a guided analysis path or allows users to switch between pre-defined perspectives easily, improving usability for complex reports.
Conclusion & Insights:

By following these steps, we leverage Power BI's capabilities beyond simple charts:

Power Query: Used for essential data shaping (parsing time, ensuring geographic compatibility) without complex coding.
Advanced Visuals: Decomposition Tree for dynamic exploration, Matrix with conditional formatting for highlighting hotspots, Maps for geographic context, Treemaps for proportions.
Enhanced Interactivity: Custom Tooltips provide deep context on hover, Bookmarks create curated analytical views.
This approach allows a Financial Data Scientist to present an insightful analysis of risk data, highlighting concentrations, distributions, and relationships across various dimensions, facilitating data-driven discussions on risk management priorities and resource allocation, all within the Power BI environment and adhering to the no-DAX constraint. The analysis focuses on how and where risks are occurring, broken down by category and team.
